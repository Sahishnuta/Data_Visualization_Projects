## Problem Statement

### Core Problem
**Analyzing the impact of different player lineups on NBA team performance to optimize coaching decisions and roster management.**

### Key Objectives

1. **Lineup Performance Evaluation**
   - Determine which 5-player combinations yield the best offensive and defensive results
   - Identify optimal lineups for specific game situations (clutch time, against particular opponents)
   - Measure lineup efficiency through advanced metrics beyond basic statistics

2. **Player Chemistry Analysis**
   - Identify which players work best together on the court
   - Analyze how individual player performance changes in different lineup configurations
   - Discover synergistic relationships between players

3. **Game Situation Optimization**
   - Find optimal lineups for different game scenarios (offensive possessions, defensive stops, closing games)
   - Analyze lineup performance in specific quarters or time segments
   - Evaluate lineup effectiveness against different opponent types

### Data Challenges Addressed

- **Complex Data Processing**: Handling large play-by-play datasets with multiple player combinations
- **Lineup Identification**: Automatically detecting which 5 players were on court during each possession
- **Performance Attribution**: Isolating lineup impact from individual player performance
- **Statistical Normalization**: Accounting for varying minutes played and opponent strength

### Analytical Approach

The solution implements:

1. **Data Collection & Processing**
   - Scraping and cleaning NBA play-by-play data
   - Identifying unique lineup combinations
   - Calculating time-on-court for each lineup

2. **Advanced Metric Calculation**
   - Traditional stats (points, rebounds, assists)
   - Advanced metrics (Net Rating, Offensive/Defensive Rating, Plus/Minus)
   - Efficiency measures (True Shooting %, Pace)

3. **Visualization & Insights**
   - Interactive dashboards for lineup comparison
   - Performance trend analysis over time
   - Player contribution breakdown within lineups

### Target Users

- **NBA Coaches & Staff**: For strategic lineup decisions and game planning
- **Front Office Executives**: For roster construction and player acquisition
- **Basketball Analysts**: For deeper understanding of team dynamics
- **Sports Bettors & Fantasy Players**: For predictive insights

### Business Impact

- **Improved Win Probability**: By deploying optimal lineups in critical situations
- **Player Development**: Identifying which combinations maximize player strengths
- **Injury Management**: Having data-driven backup lineup options
- **Strategic Advantage**: Opponent-specific lineup optimization

The code essentially solves the complex analytical challenge of translating raw NBA play-by-play data into actionable insights about team composition and player chemistry.
