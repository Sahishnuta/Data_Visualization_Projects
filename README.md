## [Project 1:Animal Shelter](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/Data_Visualization_Projects/tree/main/Animal_Shelter_Visualization)

In this project, I analyzed and visualized the insights of the chat data. The data is sourced from a group that I was part of. I just downloaded the chat as a text file from WhatsApp.

## [Project 2: Customer Analysis](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/Data_Visualization_Projects/tree/main/Customer_Analysis)

This projects aim to distinguish between a signal process that produces Higgs bosons and a background process that does not.

## [Project 3: Useful insights on Gold](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/Data_Visualization_Projects/tree/main/Gold_DataSet)

This projects aim to detect whether fraud is committed by the merchant or not using machine learning techniques based on the details of the merchant, customer and order placed by the customer.

## [Project 4: NBA Lineup Analysis](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/Data_Visualization_Projects/tree/main/NBA_Lineup_Analysis)

This project calculates “Customer Lifetime Value” with a proprietary formula to drive marketing decisions and customer relationship management.
